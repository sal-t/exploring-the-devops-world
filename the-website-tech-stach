Ok, we have the idea for the new website. Now, what do I use to create it?
Man, there is sooo much choice. The competition in this area is fierce to say the least.
I have done a lot of reading, but it still feels like I could read about this for months.
These are the links of some of the most useful stuff:

https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elm/issues/129

It all boils down to React vs Angular in most parts, and then what to use with it.
Anything else at this point would feel kind of anacronystic (Java, Ruby, pure Javascript, LAMP, etc.), or futuristic (Elm).
I really would like to try Elm for real, but I have looked a bit on linkedin Job offers, and the overwelming majority asks for some experience with React and Typescript.
And let's not forget my main goal here, to discover more about what everybody else is talking about.
So I suppose we'll have to settle for React on this.
But maybe somewhere down the line I'll give Elm a go... Maybe with Rust backend.. or Go... watch this space.
