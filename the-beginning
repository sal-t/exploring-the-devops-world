Hello!

I have decided to explore more the world of "devops" and what people seem to think it's all about.
To do so I see no better way then starting a proper project and making a full end-to-end website from scratch, including all the infrastructure needed.

As I am at it, I thought I would document the process in this blog, so that people can have a look at what I am doing and either help me out if I they think I'm doing it wrong, make use of some of the info I find, in case they want to do something similar.



This is, for now, just a dumping ground of resources, until this blog gets more structured.
