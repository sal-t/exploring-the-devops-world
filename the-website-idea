This is my idea for the website we'll build from scratch:

Real Life Food
The website will be a collection of pictures of how recipes found in internet looks like IRL!
No more fancy pics by food photographer, no more feeling ashamed about how that what was supposed to look like a fluffy cloud of a panna cotta looks more like a big lump of mash potatoes.

I am still unsure how it's gonna work, we'll work out the details as we go along, but the concept should stay.
I am thinking - no recipes, we don't want yet another recipes website.
Actually there should be a link to the recipe that was attempted, but not the recipe's itself - I suppose this way we should be safe from being sued for copyright infringment. Hopefully.
And then the pic of how it came in real life.
Can user upload their recipes and pics?
If I do that I'll have to consider a lot of aspects like avoiding people filling up my DB, even maybe with nsfw pictures, eventually user accounts with GDPR and all...
Let's say for now no users generated content, only some stuff I cook. But this might change in future.
